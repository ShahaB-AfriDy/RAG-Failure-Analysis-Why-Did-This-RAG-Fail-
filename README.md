RAG Failure Analysis: Why Did This RAG Fail?
Overview

This repository presents a structured failure analysis of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The goal of this project is not to improve performance or build a new application, but to critically analyze why a given RAG system produced incorrect, incomplete, or misleading outputs.

This project focuses on understanding system behavior, identifying failure modes, and providing technically grounded explanations.
